# Welcome to My DSA Journey! 

This repository tracks my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a collection of code snippets, notes, and projects related to various DSA concepts.

**Key Objectives:**

* Solidify my understanding of fundamental DSA concepts through practical implementation.
* Explore different algorithms and data structures in various programming languages.
* Challenge myself with practice problems and competitive coding exercises.
* Contribute to the open-source community by sharing my learnings and code.

**Contributing and Feedback:**

Feel free to fork this repository, explore the code, and share your feedback! Pull requests and suggestions are always welcome.

**Directory Structure:**

* **algorithms:** Code snippets and notes for various algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).
* **data_structures:** Code snippets and notes for implementing different data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).
* **projects:** Solutions to DSA-related projects and problems.
* **resources:** Useful links to articles, tutorials, and books on DSA.
